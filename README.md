# Google Homepage (HTML & CSS Clone)
A static visual clone of the Google homepage, built using only HTML and CSS.
This project was created a few years ago as part of an in-class assignment during my Software Engineering degree. The objective was to recreate the Google homepage layout as closely as possible, focusing purely on HTML structure and CSS styling, with no JavaScript and no external libraries.
